# üé• Movie Recommender System

Welcome to the Movie Recommender System! This AI-powered system recommends 5 similar types of movies based on user's choices using machine learning techniques. </br>
</br>

## üöÄ Features: </br>
* Content-based Recommendation: The system utilizes a content-based approach to recommend movies to users. It analyzes the features of movies and suggests similar ones based on user preferences. </br>
* Machine Learning Model: The recommendation model is trained on the TMDB dataset, which provides comprehensive movie information. The model incorporates the Cosine Similarity algorithm for final recommendation and utilizes NLTK for feature extraction. </br>
* Deployment and Visualization: The project is deployed on Streamlit, a user-friendly web framework for Python. The system showcases the output recommendations along with relevant images obtained from the TMDB API. </br>

## üìñ How it works: </br>
* User Input: Users provide their movie preferences or choices. </br>
* Feature Extraction: The system uses NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) to extract relevant features from the user's input. </br>
* Cosine Similarity: The extracted features are compared with the movie dataset using the Cosine Similarity algorithm to find similar movies. </br>
* Top Recommendations: The system generates a list of the top 5 movie recommendations based on the user's choices. </br>
* Output Visualization: The recommended movies are displayed along with images fetched from the TMDB API for a visually appealing experience. </br>

## üìö Dataset: </br>
The model is trained on the TMDB dataset, which contains a vast collection of movie information. The dataset provides valuable features that are used for movie recommendations. </br>

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used: </br>
The Movie Recommender System is built using the following technologies: </br>
* Python: Programming language used for model training and development. </br>
* Machine Learning Libraries: NLTK and Cosine Similarity algorithm for feature extraction and recommendation. </br>
* Streamlit: Web framework used for deploying the system and creating an interactive user interface. </br>
* TMDB API: API used for fetching movie information and images. </br>
